The \"rename\" system call will rename the specified files by replacing the first occurrence of expression in their name by replacement.\n\nThe \"unlink\" system call deletes a name from the filesystem. If that name was the last link to a file and no processes have the file open, the file is deleted and the space it was using is made available for reuse.\nThe \"rmdir\" system call removes empty directories.\nThe \"renameat\" system call renames a file, moving it between directories if required.\nThe \"unlinkat\" system call operates in exactly the same way as either \"unlink\" or \"rmdir\" except for the differences described in the manual page.\n\nWhen a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated.

The audit system interprets \"-1\", \"4294967295\", and \"unset\" in the same way.\n\nThe system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit.

The policy and the\nauthorization state of USB devices can be modified during runtime using the\nusbguard tool.\n\n    The System Administrator (SA) must work with the site Information System\nSecurity Officer (ISSO) to determine a list of authorized peripherals and\nestablish rules within the USBGuard software framework to allow only authorized\ndevices.",
